This vulnerability affects users working on multi-user machines, where untrusted parties have write access to the same hard disk. Those untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\\.git`, which would be picked up by Git operations run supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Git directory. Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in `C:\\.git\\config`. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround. Alternatively, define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the _parent_ directory of the user profile, e.g. `C:\\Users` if the user profile is located in `C:\\Users\\my-user-name`.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/12/7","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24765","https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-A%3A-Git-in-Other-Environments-Git-in-Bash","https://git-scm.com/docs/git#Documentation/git.txt-codeGITCEILINGDIRECTORIEScode","https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vw2c-22j4-2fh2","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5376-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5376-2","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5376-3"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-24975","PkgName":"git-man","InstalledVersion":"1:2.30.2-1","Title":"git: The --mirror option for git leaks secret for deleted content, aka the \"GitBleed\"","Description":"The --mirror documentation for Git through 2.35.1 does not mention the availability of deleted content, aka the \"GitBleed\" issue.

Specifically, this affects shadow 4.8 when compiled using --with-libpam but without explicitly passing --disable-account-tools-setuid, and without a PAM configuration suitable for use with setuid account management tools. This combination leads to account management tools (groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, useradd, userdel, usermod) that can easily be used by unprivileged local users to escalate privileges to root in multiple ways. This issue became much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version 4.8).","Severity":"HIGH","References":["https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/64836","https://bugs.gentoo.org/702252","https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/edf7547ad5aa650be868cf2dac58944773c12d75","https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/199","https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/17580","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202008-09"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2007-5686","PkgName":"login","InstalledVersion":"1:4.8.1-1","Description":"initscripts in rPath Linux 1 sets insecure permissions for the /var/log/btmp file, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information regarding authentication attempts.
