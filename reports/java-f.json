The internal function Curl_ntlm_core_mk_nt_hash multiplies the length of the password by two (SUM) to figure out how large temporary storage area to allocate from the heap. The length value is then subsequently used to iterate over the password and generate output into the allocated storage buffer. On systems with a 32 bit size_t, the math to calculate SUM triggers an integer overflow when the password length exceeds 2GB (2^31 bytes). This integer overflow usually causes a very small buffer to actually get allocated instead of the intended very huge one, making the use of that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow.

When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit [415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March 2005. In libcurl version 7.56.0, the parser always zero terminates the string but also rejects it if not terminated properly with a final double quote.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3992","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101115","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039509","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2486","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558","https://curl.haxx.se/673d0cd8.patch","https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20171004.html","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000254","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r58af02e294bd07f487e2c64ffc0a29b837db5600e33b6e698b9d696b@%3Cissues.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf4c02775860db415b4955778a131c2795223f61cb8c6a450893651e4@%3Cissues.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201712-04","https://support.apple.com/HT208331","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3441-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3441-2"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-1000121","PkgName":"curl","InstalledVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u5","FixedVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u10","Title":"curl: LDAP NULL pointer dereference","Description":"A NULL pointer dereference exists in curl 7.21.0 to and including curl 7.58.0 in the LDAP code that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2018-4258247.html","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103415","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040529","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019:0327","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3157","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0544","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0594","https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2018-97a2.html","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000121","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2018-1000121.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2018-3157.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/03/msg00012.html","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3598-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3598-2","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3598-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3598-2/","https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4136","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2019-5072801.html","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-16890","PkgName":"curl","InstalledVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u5","FixedVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u14","Title":"curl: NTLM type-2 heap out-of-bounds buffer read","Description":"libcurl versions from 7.36.0 to before 7.64.0 is vulnerable to a heap buffer out-of-bounds read.

Specially-crafted URLs that are considered illegal as of the recently published Git versions can cause Git to send a \"blank\" pattern to helpers, missing hostname and protocol fields. Many helpers will interpret this as matching _any_ URL, and will return some unspecified stored password, leaking the password to an attacker's server. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to `git clone`. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The root of the problem is in Git itself, which should not be feeding blank input to helpers. However, the ability to exploit the vulnerability in practice depends on which helpers are in use. Credential helpers which are known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git's \"store\" helper - Git's \"cache\" helper - the \"osxkeychain\" helper that ships in Git's \"contrib\" directory Credential helpers which are known to be safe even with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git Credential Manager for Windows Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger the vulnerability.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00003.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/May/41","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11008","https://github.com/git/git/commit/c44088ecc4b0722636e0a305f9608d3047197282","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-hjc9-x69f-jqj7","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-11008.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2020-2337.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/04/msg00015.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/74Q7WVJ6FKLIN62VS2JD2XCNWK5TNKOW/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MOCTR2SEHCPSCOVUQJAGFPGKFMI2VE6V/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PN3FUOXKX3AXTULYV53ACABER2W2FSOU/","https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqq4kterq5s.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202004-13","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211183","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4334-1","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4334-1/"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-5260","PkgName":"git","InstalledVersion":"1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u2","FixedVersion":"1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u9","Title":"git: Crafted URL containing new lines can cause credential leak","Description":"Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git.

In affected versions of Git a specially crafted repository that contains symbolic links as well as files using a clean/smudge filter such as Git LFS, may cause just-checked out script to be executed while cloning onto a case-insensitive file system such as NTFS, HFS+ or APFS (i.e. the default file systems on Windows and macOS). Note that clean/smudge filters have to be configured for that. Git for Windows configures Git LFS by default, and is therefore vulnerable. The problem has been patched in the versions published on Tuesday, March 9th, 2021. As a workaound, if symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work.

This bug is similar to CVE-2020-5260(GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q). The fix for that bug still left the door open for an exploit where _some_ credential is leaked (but the attacker cannot control which one). Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that are considered illegal as of the recently published Git versions can cause Git to send a \"blank\" pattern to helpers, missing hostname and protocol fields. Many helpers will interpret this as matching _any_ URL, and will return some unspecified stored password, leaking the password to an attacker's server. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to `git clone`. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The root of the problem is in Git itself, which should not be feeding blank input to helpers. However, the ability to exploit the vulnerability in practice depends on which helpers are in use. Credential helpers which are known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git's \"store\" helper - Git's \"cache\" helper - the \"osxkeychain\" helper that ships in Git's \"contrib\" directory Credential helpers which are known to be safe even with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git Credential Manager for Windows Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger the vulnerability.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00003.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/May/41","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11008","https://github.com/git/git/commit/c44088ecc4b0722636e0a305f9608d3047197282","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-hjc9-x69f-jqj7","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-11008.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2020-2337.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/04/msg00015.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/74Q7WVJ6FKLIN62VS2JD2XCNWK5TNKOW/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MOCTR2SEHCPSCOVUQJAGFPGKFMI2VE6V/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PN3FUOXKX3AXTULYV53ACABER2W2FSOU/","https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqq4kterq5s.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202004-13","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211183","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4334-1","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4334-1/"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-5260","PkgName":"git-man","InstalledVersion":"1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u2","FixedVersion":"1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u9","Title":"git: Crafted URL containing new lines can cause credential leak","Description":"Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability). The patched versions are: 2.17.4, 2.18.3, 2.19.4, 2.20.3, 2.21.2, 2.22.3, 2.23.2, 2.24.2, 2.25.3, 2.26.1.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-04/msg00027.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00003.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/157250/Git-Credential-Helper-Protocol-Newline-Injection.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/15/5","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/15/6","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/20/1","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5260","https://github.com/git/git/commit/9a6bbee8006c24b46a85d29e7b38cfa79e9ab21b","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-5260.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2020-1513.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/04/msg00010.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/74Q7WVJ6FKLIN62VS2JD2XCNWK5TNKOW/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7TVS5UG6JD3MYIGSBKMIOS6AF7CR5IPI/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MOCTR2SEHCPSCOVUQJAGFPGKFMI2VE6V/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PN3FUOXKX3AXTULYV53ACABER2W2FSOU/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XPCEOIFLLEF24L6GLVJVFZX4CREDEHDF/","https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqy2qy7xn8.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202004-13","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211141","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4329-1","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4329-1/","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4657"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-21300","PkgName":"git-man","InstalledVersion":"1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u2","Title":"git: remote code execution during clone operation on case-insensitive filesystems","Description":"Git is an open-source distributed revision control system. In affected versions of Git a specially crafted repository that contains symbolic links as well as files using a clean/smudge filter such as Git LFS, may cause just-checked out script to be executed while cloning onto a case-insensitive file system such as NTFS, HFS+ or APFS (i.e. the default file systems on Windows and macOS). Note that clean/smudge filters have to be configured for that. Git for Windows configures Git LFS by default, and is therefore vulnerable. The problem has been patched in the versions published on Tuesday, March 9th, 2021. As a workaound, if symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't work. Likewise, if no clean/smudge filters such as Git LFS are configured globally (i.e. _before_ cloning), the attack is foiled. As always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources. The earliest impacted version is 2.14.2. The fix versions are: 2.30.1, 2.29.3, 2.28.1, 2.27.1, 2.26.3, 2.25.5, 2.24.4, 2.23.4, 2.22.5, 2.21.4, 2.20.5, 2.19.6, 2.18.5, 2.17.62.17.6.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/163978/Git-LFS-Clone-Command-Execution.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Apr/60","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/09/3","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-21300","https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-coresymlinks","https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes#_filter","https://github.com/git/git/commit/684dd4c2b414bcf648505e74498a608f28de4592","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-8prw-h3cq-mghm","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BBPNGLQSYJHLZZ37BO42YY6S5OTIF4L4/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LCLJJLKKMS5WRFO6C475AOUZTWQLIARX/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LMXX2POK5X576BSDWSXGU7EIK6I72ERU/","https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqim6019yd.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202104-01","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212320","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4761-1"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-40330","PkgName":"git-man","InstalledVersion":"1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u2","Title":"git: unexpected cross-protocol requests via a repository path containing a newline character","Description":"git_connect_git in connect.c in Git before 2.30.1 allows a repository path to contain a newline character, which may result in unexpected cross-protocol requests, as demonstrated by the git://localhost:1234/%0d%0a%0d%0aGET%20/%20HTTP/1.1 substring.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-40330","https://github.com/git/git/commit/a02ea577174ab8ed18f847cf1693f213e0b9c473","https://github.com/git/git/compare/v2.30.0...v2.30.1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5076-1"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-24765","PkgName":"git-man","InstalledVersion":"1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u2","Title":"git: On multi-user machines Git users might find themselves unexpectedly in a Git worktree","Description":"Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches.

Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in `C:\\.git\\config`. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround.

When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit [415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March 2005. In libcurl version 7.56.0, the parser always zero terminates the string but also rejects it if not terminated properly with a final double quote.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3992","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101115","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039509","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2486","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558","https://curl.haxx.se/673d0cd8.patch","https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20171004.html","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1000254","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r58af02e294bd07f487e2c64ffc0a29b837db5600e33b6e698b9d696b@%3Cissues.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf4c02775860db415b4955778a131c2795223f61cb8c6a450893651e4@%3Cissues.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201712-04","https://support.apple.com/HT208331","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3441-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3441-2"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-1000121","PkgName":"libcurl3","InstalledVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u5","FixedVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u10","Title":"curl: LDAP NULL pointer dereference","Description":"A NULL pointer dereference exists in curl 7.21.0 to and including curl 7.58.0 in the LDAP code that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2018-4258247.html","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103415","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040529","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019:0327","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3157","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0544","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0594","https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2018-97a2.html","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000121","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2018-1000121.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2018-3157.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/03/msg00012.html","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3598-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3598-2","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3598-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3598-2/","https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4136","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2019-5072801.html","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-16890","PkgName":"libcurl3","InstalledVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u5","FixedVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u14","Title":"curl: NTLM type-2 heap out-of-bounds buffer read","Description":"libcurl versions from 7.36.0 to before 7.64.0 is vulnerable to a heap buffer out-of-bounds read.

Note that such a malicious HTTPS proxy needs to provide a certificate that curl will accept for the MITMed server for an attack to work - unless curl has been told to ignore the server certificate check.","Severity":"LOW","References":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf","https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2021-22890.html","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22890","https://hackerone.com/reports/1129529","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2ZC5BMIOKLBQJSFCHEDN2G2C2SH274BP/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ITVWPVGLFISU5BJC2BXBRYSDXTXE2YGC/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KQUIOYX2KUU6FIUZVB5WWZ6JHSSYSQWJ/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-36","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210521-0007/","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4898-1","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-22898","PkgName":"libcurl3","InstalledVersion":"7.38.0-4+deb8u5","Title":"curl: TELNET stack contents disclosure","Description":"curl 7.7 through 7.76.1 suffers from an information disclosure when the `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS` in libcurl, is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers.

The internal function Curl_ntlm_core_mk_nt_hash multiplies the length of the password by two (SUM) to figure out how large temporary storage area to allocate from the heap. The length value is then subsequently used to iterate over the password and generate output into the allocated storage buffer. On systems with a 32 bit size_t, the math to calculate SUM triggers an integer overflow when the password length exceeds 2GB (2^31 bytes). This integer overflow usually causes a very small buffer to actually get allocated instead of the intended very huge one, making the use of that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow.

When libcurl connects to an FTP server and successfully logs in (anonymous or not), it asks the server for the current directory with the `PWD` command. The server then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double quotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses. Due to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name passed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not adding a trailing NUL byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would then later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer and crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of the path. A malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based clients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP connections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault. The simple fact that this has issue remained undiscovered for this long could suggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers. We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. This bug was introduced in commit [415d2e7cb7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/415d2e7cb7), March 2005.

ACL restrictions bypass due to sasl_ssf value being set permanently","Description":"An issue was discovered in OpenLDAP 2.x before 2.4.48. When using SASL authentication and session encryption, and relying on the SASL security layers in slapd access controls, it is possible to obtain access that would otherwise be denied via a simple bind for any identity covered in those ACLs. After the first SASL bind is completed, the sasl_ssf value is retained for all new non-SASL connections. Depending on the ACL configuration, this can affect different types of operations (searches, modifications, etc.).

Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow.

Heap-Buffer-Overflow and Heap-Use-After-Free in Objects/fileobject.c","Description":"Python 2.7.14 is vulnerable to a Heap-Buffer-Overflow as well as a Heap-Use-After-Free. Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.","Severity":"LOW","References":["https://bugs.python.org/issue31530","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000030","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oyR9DAZjZK_SCn3mor6NRAYLJS6ueXaY/view","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201811-02","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3817-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3817-2","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-2/","https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sj3ee7xv55j36k7/AADwP-YfOYikBMuy32e0uvPFa?dl=0","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2015-8271","PkgName":"librtmp1","InstalledVersion":"2.4+20150115.gita107cef-1","FixedVersion":"2.4+20150115.gita107cef-1+deb8u1","Description":"The AMF3CD_AddProp function in amf.c in RTMPDump 2.4 allows remote RTMP Media servers to execute arbitrary code.","Severity":"CRITICAL","References":["http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3850","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95125","http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0067/","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8271","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3283-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3283-2"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2015-8270","PkgName":"librtmp1","InstalledVersion":"2.4+20150115.gita107cef-1","FixedVersion":"2.4+20150115.gita107cef-1+deb8u1","Description":"The AMF3ReadString function in amf.c in RTMPDump 2.4 allows remote RTMP Media servers to cause a denial of service (invalid pointer dereference and process crash).","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3850","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95126","http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0066/","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8270","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3283-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3283-2"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2015-8272","PkgName":"librtmp1","InstalledVersion":"2.4+20150115.gita107cef-1","FixedVersion":"2.4+20150115.gita107cef-1+deb8u1","Description":"RTMPDump 2.4 allows remote attackers to trigger a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and process crash).","Severity":"MEDIUM","References":["http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3850","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95123","http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0068/","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8272","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3283-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3283-2"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-19906","PkgName":"libsasl2-2","InstalledVersion":"2.1.26.dfsg1-13+deb8u1","FixedVersion":"2.1.26.dfsg1-13+deb8u2","Title":"cyrus-sasl: denial of service in _sasl_add_string function","Description":"cyrus-sasl (aka Cyrus SASL) 2.1.27 has an out-of-bounds write leading to unauthenticated remote denial-of-service in OpenLDAP via a malformed LDAP packet.

Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \"out\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \"outlen\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \"out\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated.

It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a \"purpose\" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named \"purpose\" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose.

This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).

Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m).

However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k).

If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant.

For example, if the victim encounters malicious terminal control sequences for color codes, then the attacker may be able to take full control of the running graphical session.","Severity":"CRITICAL","References":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162737/libX11-Insufficient-Length-Check-Injection.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/May/52","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/18/2","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-31535","https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/commit/8d2e02ae650f00c4a53deb625211a0527126c605","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-31535.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2021-4326.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r61db8e7dcb56dc000a5387a88f7a473bacec5ee01b9ff3f55308aacc@%3Cdev.kafka.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r61db8e7dcb56dc000a5387a88f7a473bacec5ee01b9ff3f55308aacc@%3Cusers.kafka.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbf4ce74b0d1fa9810dec50ba3ace0caeea677af7c27a97111c06ccb7@%3Cdev.kafka.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbf4ce74b0d1fa9810dec50ba3ace0caeea677af7c27a97111c06ccb7@%3Cusers.kafka.apache.org%3E","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/05/msg00021.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TEOT4RLB76RVPJQKGGTIKTBIOLHX2NR6/","https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/","https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2021-May/003088.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-16","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210813-0001/","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4966-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4966-2","https://unparalleled.eu/blog/2021/20210518-using-xterm-to-navigate-the-huge-color-space/","https://unparalleled.eu/publications/2021/advisory-unpar-2021-1.txt","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4920","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/18/2","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/18/3"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-14598","PkgName":"libx11-6","InstalledVersion":"2:1.6.2-3","FixedVersion":"2:1.6.2-3+deb8u2","Title":"libX11: Crash on invalid reply in XListExtensions in ListExt.c","Description":"An issue was discovered in XListExtensions in ListExt.c in libX11 through 1.6.5.

For example, if the victim encounters malicious terminal control sequences for color codes, then the attacker may be able to take full control of the running graphical session.","Severity":"CRITICAL","References":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162737/libX11-Insufficient-Length-Check-Injection.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/May/52","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/18/2","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-31535","https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/commit/8d2e02ae650f00c4a53deb625211a0527126c605","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-31535.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2021-4326.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r61db8e7dcb56dc000a5387a88f7a473bacec5ee01b9ff3f55308aacc@%3Cdev.kafka.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r61db8e7dcb56dc000a5387a88f7a473bacec5ee01b9ff3f55308aacc@%3Cusers.kafka.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbf4ce74b0d1fa9810dec50ba3ace0caeea677af7c27a97111c06ccb7@%3Cdev.kafka.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbf4ce74b0d1fa9810dec50ba3ace0caeea677af7c27a97111c06ccb7@%3Cusers.kafka.apache.org%3E","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/05/msg00021.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TEOT4RLB76RVPJQKGGTIKTBIOLHX2NR6/","https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/","https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2021-May/003088.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-16","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210813-0001/","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4966-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4966-2","https://unparalleled.eu/blog/2021/20210518-using-xterm-to-navigate-the-huge-color-space/","https://unparalleled.eu/publications/2021/advisory-unpar-2021-1.txt","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4920","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/18/2","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/18/3"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-14598","PkgName":"libx11-xcb1","InstalledVersion":"2:1.6.2-3","FixedVersion":"2:1.6.2-3+deb8u2","Title":"libX11: Crash on invalid reply in XListExtensions in ListExt.c","Description":"An issue was discovered in XListExtensions in ListExt.c in libX11 through 1.6.5.

Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \"out\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \"outlen\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \"out\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash.

It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a \"purpose\" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named \"purpose\" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose.

This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).

Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue.

Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021.

Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow.

Python versions prior to 2.7.14 may also be vulnerable and it appears that Python 2.7.17 and prior may also be vulnerable however this has not been confirmed. The vulnerability lies when multiply threads are handling large amounts of data. In both cases there is essentially a race condition that occurs. For the Heap-Buffer-Overflow, Thread 2 is creating the size for a buffer, but Thread1 is already writing to the buffer without knowing how much to write. So when a large amount of data is being processed, it is very easy to cause memory corruption using a Heap-Buffer-Overflow. As for the Use-After-Free, Thread3->Malloc->Thread1->Free's->Thread2-Re-uses-Free'd Memory. The PSRT has stated that this is not a security vulnerability due to the fact that the attacker must be able to run code, however in some situations, such as function as a service, this vulnerability can potentially be used by an attacker to violate a trust boundary, as such the DWF feels this issue deserves a CVE.","Severity":"LOW","References":["https://bugs.python.org/issue31530","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000030","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oyR9DAZjZK_SCn3mor6NRAYLJS6ueXaY/view","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201811-02","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3817-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3817-2","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3817-2/","https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sj3ee7xv55j36k7/AADwP-YfOYikBMuy32e0uvPFa?dl=0","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2017-17512","PkgName":"sensible-utils","InstalledVersion":"0.0.9","FixedVersion":"0.0.9+deb8u1","Description":"sensible-browser in sensible-utils before 0.0.11 does not validate strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which allows remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL, as demonstrated by a --proxy-pac-file argument.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs/main/s/sensible-utils/sensible-utils_0.0.11_changelog","https://bugs.debian.org/881767","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17512","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2017/12/msg00012.html","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-3584-1","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3584-1/","https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-4071"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2017-9800","PkgName":"subversion","InstalledVersion":"1.8.10-6+deb8u4","FixedVersion":"1.8.10-6+deb8u5","Title":"subversion: Command injection through clients via malicious svn+ssh URLs","Description":"A maliciously constructed svn+ssh:// URL would cause Subversion clients before 1.8.19, 1.9.x before 1.9.7, and 1.10.0.x through 1.10.0-alpha3 to run an arbitrary shell command.
