When zgrep is applied on the attacker's chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker's content to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficient validation when processing filenames with two or more newlines where selected content and the target file names are embedded in crafted multi-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-1271","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2022-1271.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2022-1537.html","https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gzip/2022-04/msg00011.html","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5378-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5378-2","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5378-3","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5378-4","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/07/8"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2020-12762","PkgName":"json-c","InstalledVersion":"0.13.1-0.4.el8","FixedVersion":"0.13.1-2.el8","Title":"json-c: integer overflow and out-of-bounds write via a large JSON file","Description":"json-c through 0.14 has an integer overflow and out-of-bounds write via a large JSON file, as demonstrated by printbuf_memappend.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12762","https://github.com/json-c/json-c/pull/592","https://github.com/rsyslog/libfastjson/issues/161","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-12762.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2021-4382.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/05/msg00032.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/05/msg00034.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/07/msg00031.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CBR36IXYBHITAZFB5PFBJTED22WO5ONB/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CQQRRGBQCAWNCCJ2HN3W5SSCZ4QGMXQI/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/W226TSCJBEOXDUFVKNWNH7ETG7AR6MCS/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202006-13","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210521-0001/","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4360-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4360-4","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4360-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4360-4/","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4741"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-20269","PkgName":"kexec-tools","InstalledVersion":"2.0.20-46.el8","FixedVersion":"2.0.20-57.el8","Title":"kexec-tools: incorrect permissions on kdump dmesg file","Description":"A flaw was found in the permissions of a log file created by kexec-tools.

This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).

Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.
