When zgrep is applied on the attacker's chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker's content to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficient validation when processing filenames with two or more newlines where selected content and the target file names are embedded in crafted multi-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-1271","https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2022-1271.html","https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2022-1537.html","https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gzip/2022-04/msg00011.html","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5378-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5378-2","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5378-3","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5378-4","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/07/8"]}]}
