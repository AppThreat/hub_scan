Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround. Alternatively, define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the _parent_ directory of the user profile, e.g. `C:\\Users` if the user profile is located in `C:\\Users\\my-user-name`.","Severity":"HIGH","References":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/12/7","https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24765","https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-A%3A-Git-in-Other-Environments-Git-in-Bash","https://git-scm.com/docs/git#Documentation/git.txt-codeGITCEILINGDIRECTORIEScode","https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vw2c-22j4-2fh2","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5376-1","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5376-2","https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-5376-3"]},{"VulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-24975","PkgName":"git-man","InstalledVersion":"1:2.30.2-1","Title":"git: The --mirror option for git leaks secret for deleted content, aka the \"GitBleed\"","Description":"The --mirror documentation for Git through 2.35.1 does not mention the availability of deleted content, aka the \"GitBleed\" issue.
